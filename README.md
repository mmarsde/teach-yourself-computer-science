# Teach Yourself Computer Science
A portfolio mono repo, containing lecture notes/reflective writeups, practice exercise solutions and capstone projects necessary to become well versed in the subject of **Computer Science**.

This is primarily a ***personal learning project***. The contents of this repository is intended for personal reference and to showcase the knowledge and skills acquired through self-directed learning.

At present, I am following the programme and utilising the resources outlined by [Teach Yourself Computer Science]([https://](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)). They have kindly taken the time to curate an excellent list of learning materials, and provide guidance around the core topics necessary to obtain a world class education in CS. I have linked to them above, if you'd like to review their content. As part of this journey, I'll be covering the following subjects:
